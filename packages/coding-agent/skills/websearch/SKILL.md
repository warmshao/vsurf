# Web Search

Search the web via the Serper Google Search API.

## Setup

Get a free API key at https://serper.dev, then run `/login` in VSurf,
switch to **MCP Connections**, and choose **Serper (web search)** to paste it.
The key is stored in VSurf and made available to this skill automatically.

If web search reports a missing key, walk the user through those two steps;
don't ask them to set environment variables.

Optional overrides (environment variables):

- `VSURF_WEBSEARCH_TIMEOUT` - HTTP timeout in seconds (default 45).
- `VSURF_WEBSEARCH_NUM_RESULTS` - number of organic results to return (default 5).

## Usage

Call the prepared `websearch` import directly in the IPython kernel:

```python
print(await websearch("latest VSurf release"))
```
